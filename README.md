Some Cocoa Thread Utilities
===========

##Semaphore

Semaphores allow you to vend a desired number of permits accross multiple threads in a thread-safe manner. 

For example, you may have a pool of a limited number of resources you'd like to vend accross multiple threads. A semaphore can help you do this.

####Create

Create a semaphore with 7 available permits:

    TDSemaphore *sem = [TDSemaphore semaphoreWithValue:7];

####Acquire

There are three different ways to acquire a permit on the current thread. Use one of the following according to your needs:

1. Blocks current thread (possibly forever) until one of the semaphore's permits is acquired:

        [sem acquire];

1. Tries to acquire one of semaphore's permits without blocking the current thread. Always returns immediately with a success indicator:

        BOOL success = [sem attempt];

1. Tries to acquire one of semaphore's permits for up to 10 seconds while blocking the current thread. Always returns within roughly 10 seconds with a success indicator:

        NSDate *date = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:10.0];
        
        BOOL success = [sem attemptBeforeDate:date];

Note that all of the above acquisition methods use signal broadcasting techniques (specifically, `NSConditionLock`). **NONE** involve any polling or busy waiting. 

####Relinquish

To relinquish a semaphore's permit owned by the current thread:

    [sem relinquish]; // always returns immediately

##Synchronous Channel

Synchronous channels allow two threads to rendezvous while one thread passes an object to the other. If the "giver" thread arrives at the rendezvous point first, the giver thread will block until the "taker" thread arrives, and has taken the object being given. Alternatively, if the "taker" thread arrives at the rendezvous first, it blocks until the "giver" thread has arrived and given an object to be taken.

So if you have a thread which cannot continue execution until it is guaranteed to have successfully passed an object to another thread, a synchronous channel can help.

####Create

Create a synchronous channel:

    TDSynchronousChannel *chan = [TDSynchronousChannel synchronousChannel];

####Give

The "giver" thread should call `-put:`, which will block until another thread has successfully taken the object:

    // on "giver" thread
    
    id obj = // â€¦find an object to be given
    
    [chan put:obj]; // blocks until `obj` taken by another thread

####Take
The "taker" thread should call `-take`, which will block until another thread has given an object to be taken:

    // on "taker" thread
    
    id obj = [chan take]; // blocks until another thread "gives"    

Note that the order in which these two threads "arrive" at the rendezvous (that is, the order they call `-put:` or `-take`) does not matter. Indeed, across threads it can be difficult to define execution "order" at all. Neither thread will continue beyond the rendezvous point until the object has been successfully taken.

Note that the  `-put:` and `-take` methods use signal broadcasting techniques (specifically, `NSConditionLock`). They **DO NOT** involve any polling or busy waiting.
